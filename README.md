150522 update.

Created a HTML CSS JS version to learn the minimax algorithm. Although I did manage to write it, something about it feels off but I can't exactly pinpoint it yet. Might update it again if I see something wrong.

I did not really style the javascript version since I made it mainly for my own learning and practice.

I'm not providing a live weblink for the HTML CSS JS version as there is no point playing since its impossible to win anyways. Hoever, if you'd really want to try it, you may download the .html, .css, and .js files and run the .html file in your web browser.
